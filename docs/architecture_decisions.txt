Here is the architecture decisions that I user to refactor the application from Monolith to microservice.

1. Persons API:
  - Separation from the API bundle makes sense because this is the main connection point for the frontend 
  - Separating this service is beneficial to scaling the application.

2. Location API:
  - the Location API is used to extract the location from the database.
  - Separating this into a its own microservice will reduce the traffic from the person api.

3. Location Producer:
  - A gRPC Kafka Producer.
  - This will be a good efficient way and will match the requirement of processing a lot of users data concurrently.

4. Location Consumer:
  - reads data from a Kafka queue and writes it to a database.
